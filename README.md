Groundhog is a crowdsourced search engine.  Think reddit for google.  Every search query becomes a discussion.  Others who have walked in your shoes, wondering the same things, can contribute their findings, their insights, their reactions.  Specific to your search.  

Results are ranked by a combination of Google’s own Page Rank and user subitted votes.  Results have comments, which can be upvoted and downvoted.

Searches can have comments.

PageRank is algorithmically cool.  But it’s cold and impersonal.  We’re adding the human factor back to it.

Features:
=========
- **Dig** with others through relevant search results without having to sort through all the crap.
- **Discuss** directly under your searches to find out how helpful the page was.
- **Explore** the most relevant queries and sites for a specific topic.
- **Seamless with the Google search engine**
